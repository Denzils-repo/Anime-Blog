            <section>
            <h2>Shonen(Action):</h2>
            <p>The Shonen Genre is widely popular among the anime fans and sits at the top compared to all the other genre and it mainly revolves around a male protagonist and good long story line consisting of action scenes and other major strong plots related to friendship, rivalry and more.</p>

            height="300px"
            width="600px"
            title="One piece episode 1"></iframe>
            <p>Now, For the recommendation part i have decided this will go to <strong>One Piece</strong> one of the Big 3 anime. It is watched and loved by millions of people it has a great story line and is rich with different arcs and strong topics.

        <div>
            <h2>Isekai (Another World):</h2>
            <p>
                The Isekai genre has rapidly gained popularity in the anime community. It typically features a protagonist who is transported, reborn, or trapped in another world, often with new abilities and a chance to start life over. These stories explore themes like world-building, fantasy settings, and personal growth, and are often filled with action, adventure, and strategic world domination or survival.

                title="That time i fot reincarnated as a slime ep 1">
            </iframe>
            <p>
                For this genre, I recommend <strong>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</strong>. It tells the story of a regular man who is reincarnated into a fantasy world as a powerful slime with unique abilities. The anime combines action, strategy, and diplomacy, while building an engaging world full of monsters, magic, and alliances. It's a great entry point into Isekai and a fan favorite.

            <section>
            <h2>Slice of Life:</h2>
            <p>
                The Slice of Life genre focuses on everyday experiences, often highlighting school life, relationships, and the emotional highs and lows of ordinary people. These stories are usually grounded in reality, providing a relaxing or heartwarming experience with relatable characters and subtle drama.

                allowfullscreen
                height="300px" 
                width="600px"
                title="Horimiya episode 1">
            </iframe>
            <p>
                For this genre, I recommend <strong>Horimiya</strong>. It beautifully explores the relationship between two high school students who each live very different lives in and out of school. With emotional storytelling, charming characters, and a touch of humor, Horimiya delivers a refreshing take on love and friendship in a modern high school setting.
